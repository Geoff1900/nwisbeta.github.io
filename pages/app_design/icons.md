Icons must be consistent with the open source [Material.io icon set](https://material.io/tools/icons/?style=baseline).  

Design a new icon only if the Material.io icon set does not provide a suitable icon. 

Do design a new icon rather than misusing existing icons (iOS Human Interface Guidelines).  

Icons must:
* be clear, single tone and forward facing (Material.io, iOS Human Interface Guidelines)  
* used consistently across the app - see [Icons and Assets](/icons-assets.html)  
* appear in appropriate colours - see [Branding](/branding.html)  
* use colour to indicate selected and deselected states: do not use two different icons to indicate selected and deselected states such as a solid and outlined version (iOS Human Interface Guidelines)>  
* be labelled with appropriate text (WCAG 2.1), in title case: do not include text within an icon (iOS Human Interface Guidelines)  

### Home icon

Icon touch targets must be a minimum of 44px x 44px and surrounded by a small amount of inactive space (WCAG 2.1, Material.io).  
  
Save icons in PNG or SGV formats (Material.io).  

Store app icons in 1024px x 1024px resolution.
