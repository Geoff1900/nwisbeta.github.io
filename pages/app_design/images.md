Use NWIS branding images within the app - see [Branding](/branding.html).  Avoid using other images unless a real user need exists (GOV.UK Design System).  

The app must: 
* display images at their intended aspect ratio  
* use PNG files (iOS Human Interface Guidelines)  
* provide alternative text labels either immediately adjacent to the image or on clicking the image, to support screen readers (see Accessibility) (Material.io, iOS Human Interface Guidelines)  
* download images from a server with image caching enabled, to allow faster app loading and to reduce the size of the app itself
