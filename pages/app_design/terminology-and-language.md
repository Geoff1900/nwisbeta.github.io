# Terminology
Standard terms must be used throughout the app (iOS Human Interface Guidelines) (see Tools > Terms)  
Terms must be clear and easy to understand (iOS Human Interface Guidelines)  
Terms must be familiar and friendly (iOS Human Interface Guidelines)  
Avoid the use of patronising terms for example 'we', 'our', and 'me' (i.e. My Settings) (iOS Human Interface Guidelines)  

# Language
Apps must be developed with provision for translation to other languages using language flags (see Core Guidelines > Flags)  
If the mobile app is being used for a right alignment language as an option then there needs to be a layout flag that swaps the alignment accordingly  

# Flags
Language flags must be used for text fields  *UNCLEAR what are these?*
