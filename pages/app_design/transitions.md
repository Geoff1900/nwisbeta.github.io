Transitions must be used to allow the user to navigate across related categories on a single page through clicking on category tabs (Material.io)  
* Swipe gesture must be used to enable users to swipe across the related categories
* Example: Moving between patient, ward or consultant lists

Transitions must be used to allow the user to reveal more detailed information if by expanding a higher level component to include lower level components and reinforcing that the components are related (Material.io)  
* The user must be able to minimise lower level components back to the higher category (original state)  
* Example: Viewing additional patient information
Avoid transitions being too fast or too slow  
* Transitions should not be faster than 100ms (Material.io)
* Transitions should not be slower than 300ms (Material.io)
