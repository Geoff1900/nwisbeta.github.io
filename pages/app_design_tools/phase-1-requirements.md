The requirements phase documents the specific needs or opportunities that the mobile app will address. This should be headed by a top-level requirement followed by a set of lower level requirements. The requirements are defined by the stakeholders who are typically the problem owners and/or end users.

Example: The top-level requirement is for a mobile app that helps clinicians manage their patients better. To do this the app needs to:

Access patient records
Allow clinician interaction with a patient record
Alert a clinician when there is a deterioration in a patientâ€™s condition
Provide functionality to allow a clinician to manage their job tasks
Comply with NHS Wales information and clinical governance
The requirements are the Core Guidelines of mobile app development and are used as inputs into the design stage as below. They are also a key input into verification. Testing must trace back to specific requirements.

Depending on methodology and stakeholder engagement, requirements can either be developed in parallel (agile method) with design and implementation phases, or before (waterfall method).

If requirements are developed in parallel with design and implementation phases then the requirements phase must refer to design standards documentation.
