The app design must distinguish external source displays (from other systems) from in-app information. Highlight external source displays in NWIS Green: RGB: 151 204 57, CMYK: 49 0 89 0, HEX: #97CC39. Use interrupted underlining to further discriminate them.
  
In the design and implementation phases, consider:  
* how to provision of open standards and APIs for integration with other systems and services  
* how to display information from external sources  
* notifying users about sharing information with other systems and services
