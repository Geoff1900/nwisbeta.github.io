## Documentation process to date

* assess existing documentation available
* define documentation requirements: API guide based on best practice
* examine best practice and comperable API documentation examples, as modelled by NHS Digital [https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/). Examples include:
  * Minimum viable product sample: [http://www.openods.co.uk/](http://www.openods.co.uk/) 
  * Target product sample: [https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/ods/](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/ods/)
  * High quality example for depth and thoroughness [https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/nrls/index.html](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/nrls/index.html)
  
* move existing documentation from Word and PDF format to GitHub, in the preferred Jekyll documentation theme
* ask questions to address gaps in current documentation, particularly user need and audience
* refine existing documentation towards the example goals

## Content review process

* publish a draft and notify subject matter experts (SMEs)
* define review needs: focus on technical accuracy, ensuring no errors were introduced in moving content to GitHub
* set a deadline for review comments so changes are available by publishing deadline
* review meeting to consider input and changes, and agree what to changes (optional) 
* incorporate comments and publish update, incrementing the document number and title as required
