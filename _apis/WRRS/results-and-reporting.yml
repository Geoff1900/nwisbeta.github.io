description: Request lab tests for any sample such as blood or bone, etc.
type: SOAP/XML
owner: NWIS - Integration and Reference
overview: |
 This service acts as a mediator between user facing applications and the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) service.
 When a user facing application such as WCP or GPTR requests a test, the lab gets notified and they are prepared for the sample when it arrives.
 This service also returns a barcode which is printed off and attached to the sample before it gets sent.
 Currently WRRS is only used by two NWIS applications, Welsh Clinical Portal (WCP) and GP Test Results (GPTR). This service is available nationally.
