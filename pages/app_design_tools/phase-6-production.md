This is the live phase where the mobile app is expected to be rolled out at scale to the target end user audience.

Minor UX and/or UI changes such as icon positioning, font size or colours are permitted.

If major UX and/or UI changes are needed then it must be rolled back to a pre-Demonstrator phase.
