A consistent layout must be used across similar pages and components (WCAG 2.1, Material.io, iOS Human Interface Guidelines)  
Example: Consistent menu item locations and button locations

<div class="col-sm-12">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-md-6 col-lg-6">
			<h3>Generic App Layout</h3>
			<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" src="/images/examples/design-standards-generic-layout.png">
		</div>
				
		<div class="col-md-6 col-lg-6">
			<h3>Log In Page</h3>
			<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" src="/images/examples/design-standards-layout-login.png">
		</div>
	
	</div>
</div>			


Navigation menus must be displayed at the top and bottom of each page (see Navigation > Menus)  
Where search functionality is present the search bar must be displayed at the top centre of each page (see Navigation > Search)  
Consider and refer to layout standards, standard access points (see Navigation > Menus) and standard features (see Core Guidelines > Standard Features) including profile (top left), settings (top right) and home (bottom centre), as per Figure below  
Do not use more than two columns on a page with portrait orientation  
Central column must be used for pages that do not display data  
Most important data should be centralised as a heading where appropriate  
Columns must be used to clearly display information  
Information type must be in the left column  
Relevant information must be in bold in the right column  
Example: Patient information â€“ Name: SMITH, John  
Pages with a list of items must have a single column with left text alignment  
Title, heading, subtitle, body text must be used consistently (see Core Guidelines > Typography)  
Avoid the need for excessive scrolling/do not display too much information on one page as defined below (WCAG 2.1, ICO, GDPR)  
Most important information must be visible without the need for scrolling (WCAG 2.1)  
Avoid displaying more than ten data fields on one page (see User Interaction > Data Entry)  
More than ten data fields must be displayed across multiple pages  
Data fields must be displayed as one data field on each row  
Margins and spacing should be used where possible (iOS Human Interface Guidelines, Material.io, UWP)  
App Examples:


<div class="col-sm-12">
		<div class="row">

		<div class="col-md-6 col-lg-6">
			<h3>Patient Information</h3>
			<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" src="/images/examples/design-standards-layout-patient-info.png">
