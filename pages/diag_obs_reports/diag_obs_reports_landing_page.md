## Introduction 

The Diagnostic Observations and Reports API enables users to retrieve a patient's test results using the patient's NHS number (parameter: identifier).

{% include note.html content="The data within the service is test data and must not be considered or used for live use. While the API implements the full FHIR specification, it only contains the data for 100 fictitious patient records." %}
