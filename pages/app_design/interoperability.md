External source displays (from other systems) must be differentiated from in app information
External source displays must be highlighted in NWIS Green: RGB: 151 204 57, CMYK: 49 0 89 0, HEX: #97CC39, and interrupted underlining to further discriminate them
Consideration in the design and implementation phases needs to be given to:
Provision of open standards and APIs for integration with other systems and services
Information display from external sources
Notifying users regarding sharing information with other systems and services
