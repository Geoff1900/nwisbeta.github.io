NHS Wales Informatics Services (NWIS) and the Life Sciences Hub Wales, supported by Welsh Government's Efficiency Through Technology Programme, are creating the Digital Health Ecosystem Wales (DHEW) network.
 
More information about the DHEW at [Life Sciences Hub Wales website](https://www.lifescienceshubwales.com/dhew/)  
 
The goal is to create a library of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that implementers can adopt to simplify integration and interoperability with NHS Wales National Architecture.

The project will provide access to the NHS Wales architecture in incremental phases, using internet-based application programming interfaces (APIs).  The initial phases deliver access to test case APIs.
