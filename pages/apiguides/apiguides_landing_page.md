## Introduction 

The NHS Wales National Architecture includes a large number of application and other integration capabilities. NWIS are deploying these capabilities to support information sharing between applications and services. The goal is to reduce duplication of information collection, to improve care efficiency, and to ensure patient safety.  

The NHS Wales Software Development Kit supports NHS Wales organisations and other partners in the public and private sector. It provides detailed information to enable standardised application development to a wider audience of developers and system suppliers.   

## Digital Health Ecosystem for Wales (DHEW)
