Most mobile apps exhibit common features such as the Home and Settings screens  
This section guides how to implement standard features in a common manner  
Standard features must be used where relevant  
Consistent terms (shared naming conventions) must be used for all standard features (see Tools > Terms)  
Consistent icons (a shared icon set) must be used for all standard features (see Tools > Icons)  
Consistent menu access points must be used for standard features (see Navigation > Menus)  

# Home
Home is also commonly referred to as either "The Home Page" or "The Main Screen/Page".  
Home must include most important app feature (primary reason for app) or provide a summary of most important information.  
Home can be configured or personalised in settings if required.  


#### Example homepage displaying the most important feature for a specific clinical app

Scroll gestures must be used to allow the user to move through the feed items (see Navigation > Gesture Control)  
Swipe down gesture must be used to allow the user to refresh the feed (see Navigation > Gesture Control)  
Clicking the feed menu item whilst in the feed must scroll to the top of the feed and refresh the page (see Navigation > Menus)  

#Connection and communication functions
Connection and communication functions are intended to cover connecting or communicating with people or entities, for example: a ward or patient within a particular hospital  
A search bar should be present at the top of the page to allow the user to search for connections  
Scroll gestures should be used to allow the user to move through connections and communications (see Navigation > Gesture Control)  
Swipe down gesture should be used to allow the user to refresh connections/communications (see Navigation > Gesture Control)  
Clicking the connection/communication group menu item whilst in the feed must scroll to the top of the page and refresh the page (see Navigation > Menus)  

#### Example generic connection/communication page covering community and communication features

# Watchlist and alerts
Watchlist and alerts must be accessible on clinician apps  
* Notifications are generally used instead of watchlist/alerts for patient facing apps (see Standard Features > Notifications)  
Watchlist and alerts must be ordered from highest to lowest priority (see Navigation > Ordering)  
Scroll gesture must be used to allow the user to navigate through items (see Navigation > Gesture Control)  
Swipe down gesture must be used to allow the user to refresh the page (see Navigation > Gesture Control)  
Clicking the watchlist/alerts menu item whilst in the watchlist/alerts menu must scroll to the top of the feed and refresh the page (see Navigation > Gesture Control)  

## Watchlist
Users must be able to modify which patients or people appear on their watchlist  
## Alerts
Any alert must be addressed and resolved using protocols that have been established and signed off at the executive governance level. For clinical alerts signing off must be completed by both clinical and information governance personnel. The date and national body that signed off the protocols must be displayed at the top of this alert section and updated or ratified periodically.  

| Alert Protocol Version | Sign Off Date | Signatories (list) |
|------------------------|---------------|--------------------|
| Pending                |               |                    |

	
Alerts must be displayed with the time and date they were triggered  
Critical alerts must provide a notification to the user  
Critical notifications within the app (see User Interaction > Pop Ups) should prevent the user from doing other things until they take action (iOS Human Interface Guidelines)  
Critical alerts must be acknowledged by the user  
Important alerts must appear at the top of the page until acknowledged by the user  
Once an alert has been acknowledged it must be stored as a past alert and displayed with a different colour background to differentiate it from current alerts  
One month history of alerts must be displayed (load 10 items at a time)  
Feed/watchlist icons must signal alerts/important notices on the bottom menu  

#### Example alert notification
<img src="/images/examples/design-standards-sf-feed-notification-icon.png" style="max-width: 100px;">

Alerts must be displayed in an accessible format that differentiates high, medium and low priority alerts without relying on colour (see Accessibility) (WCAG 2.1)  
* High priority alerts must be displayed with a hexagon with NWIS red fill  
* Medium priority alerts must be displayed with a triangle with a NWIS orange fill  
* If low priority alerts are to be used they must be displayed with a square with NWIS yellow fill  
Optional discriminators relating to contrast between message/border and fill  
* High priority alerts may be displayed with highest density contrast message text/number and border   
* Medium priority alerts may be displayed with a high density contrast message text/number and border  
I If low priority alerts are to be used they may be displayed with a standard density (W3C compliant) contrast message text/number border  
The above guidelines ensures that colour must not be used as the only visual representation of alerts (Material.io)


# Notifications
Any notification must be addressed and resolved using protocols that have been established and signed off at the executive governance level. For clinical notifications signing off must be completed by both clinical and information governance personnel. The date and national body that signed off the protocols must be displayed at the top of this alert section and updated or ratified at least annually.

| Notification Protocol Version | Sign Off Date | Signatories (list) |
|-------------------------------|---------------|--------------------|
| Pending                       |               |                    |
