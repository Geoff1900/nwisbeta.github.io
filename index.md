## Digital Health Ecosystem for Health and Care across Wales

NHS Wales Informatics Services (NWIS) and the Life Sciences Hub Wales, supported by Welsh Governmentâ€™s Efficiency Through Technology Programme, are creating the Digital Health Ecosystem Wales (DHEW) network.
 
More information at [Life Sciences Hub Wales website](https://www.lifescienceshubwales.com/dhew/)  
 
The project will provide access to the NHS Wales architecture in incremental phases, using internet-based application programming interfaces (APIs).  The initial phases deliver access to test case APIs.
 
 The test system is available at [ https://dhew.wales.nhs.uk/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-example/](https://dhew.wales.nhs.uk/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-example/)
