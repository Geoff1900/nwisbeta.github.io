For the purposes of these standards the Demonstrator, or Alpha, phases involve developing and releasing a complete version of the mobile application. The demonstrator allows stakeholder evaluation of the system and fine tuning prior to the live Beta release. It is also to check robustness and complete governance requirements, documentation and sign off.

Major UX and/or UI changes such as changes in screen layout or workflows must not occur during the demonstrator phase.

If major UX and/or UI changes are needed then the development must roll back to a pre-Demonstrator phase.

Prior to release for stakeholder validation the development team must test and validate performance using the standard configuration software and hardware devices.

Minor UX and/or UI changes such as changes in icon positioning, font size or colours may be implemented during the Demonstrator phase.
