# Principles

The design standards have been produced to align with the following principles

* Usability for developers being easy to use and understand
* Usefulness in that the guidance as a whole and in parts addresses valid existing or potential UX or UI design issue(s)
* Minimally restrictive with attention made to not limit potential useful functions, features and/or innovations
* Interoperability with current and future facing standards, services and products as possible
* Easily implemented with minimal technical barriers or resource implications
* Progressive, dynamic and responsive to emerging standards and best practice
* Accessible for the target stakeholder audience with consideration of potential barriers to access including disabilities
