The Beta phase is the live release of the mobile application where it will be used in real world testing with clinical and/or other live data.

Major UX and/or UI changes such as changes in screen layout or workflows must not occur during the demonstrator phase.

If major UX and/or UI changes are needed then the development must roll back to a pre-Demonstrator phase.

Minor UX and/or UI changes such as changes in icon positioning, font size or colours may be implemented during the Beta phase.
