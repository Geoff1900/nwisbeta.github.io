## Terminology Principles

Use terms consistently throughout the app (iOS Human Interface Guidelines). Some terms are provided in this standard.
Choose terms that are familiar, friendly, clear, and easy to understand (iOS Human Interface Guidelines).

Avoid patronising sentence constructions: for example, referring to users as 'we', 'our', and 'me' (i.e. My Settings) (iOS Human Interface Guidelines).  

Use a readability test tool like [WebFX's read-able](https://www.webfx.com/tools/read-able/) to test content reading level.

## Language
Apps must include provision for translation to other languages using language flags (see Core Guidelines > Flags).
  
If the mobile app requirements include a right-alignment language as an option, use a layout flag swap the alignment accordingly.  

## Flags
Use language flags for text fields  *UNCLEAR what are these?*

## Preferred General Terms

Use these terms for labels and instruction text.
