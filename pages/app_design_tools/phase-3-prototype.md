The prototype phase involves developing an incomplete version of the mobile application to allow for testing against the requirements. The purpose of the prototype is to allow stakeholder to evaluate the first implementation of the design through using the prototype. Prototyping can also be used to generate further requirements that need to feed back into the design and implementation phases.

The prototype must utilise the mobile app design UI and UX elements.

During the prototype phase the development team must define the device hardware and software standard for testing the mobile app against performance standards.

Example: iPhone 7, Capacity 128 GB, Free capacity >64 GB, Software Version 11.3.1 or higher, Model MKQT2BA/A
