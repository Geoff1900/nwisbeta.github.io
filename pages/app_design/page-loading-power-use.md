Aim for pages to load within 2 seconds.
If pages do not load within 1 second, a moving loading or progress indicator must appear. See [Icons and Assets](/icons-assets.html) for downloadable icons in white.

Swipe down gesture must enable users to manually refresh pages, where information is regularly updated (Material.io) (see Navigation > Gesture Control).  

### Example page loading indicator displayed when page loading is delayed

## Power Efficiency
Follow best practice app design to minimise battery drainage by the app.   
The menu must include controls so users can turn off and on all non-critical features, that contribute to >5% of total app power use.
