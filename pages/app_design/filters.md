Filters should allow the user to narrow search options using the simplest method available, such as a toggle for yes/no options.  Do not display irrelevant filter options.  

Avoid using more than seven filter options.    

The design must provide both filter results text and icon when displaying filter results, so the user can change filter options.

The design must allow users to reset filter options.
