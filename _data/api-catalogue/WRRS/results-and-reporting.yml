 This service mediates requests to Laboratory and Radiology Management Systems and returns request IDs  
 so that specimens can be labelled and subsequently identified when received by laboratories.
 The API also allows search/retrieval of a patients previous test requests and results. 
 Applications use it to allow users in hospitals and GP surgeries to request diagnostic tests, generate
 barcode labels for the specimen containers and display results as either a detailed list or chart and table.
 It is available nationally in primary and secondary care.
