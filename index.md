---

NHS Wales Informatics Services (NWIS) are using a Health Application Programming Interface (HAPI) FHIR server to test and build a library of RESTful Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that implementers can adopt to simplify integration and interoperability with NHS Wales National Architecture.

The project will provide access to the NHS Wales architecture in incremental phases, using internet-based application programming interfaces (APIs).  The initial phases deliver access to test case APIs.
