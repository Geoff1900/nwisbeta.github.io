# Terminology

The following terms in this guide have specific meanings as below and are consistently used in other NWIS software development standards. They will be in italic format throughout the standards.

Do/must: this must be enforced

Do not/must not: this is not permitted

Should/should not: target best practice specification however cannot always be achieved due to external factors such as device differences (e.g. type, other software installed and working memory)

Avoid: this should be prevented but is tolerated in some circumstances
If required: this should only be used if appropriate or required but is not enforced

Exceptions: sometimes exceptions to these standards are necessary to optimise UI and/or UX. These are stated in the text but must always be accompanied by the appropriate documentation, including senior stakeholder sign-off, linked to the development checklists (see Tools > Exceptions)

Example: this provides an example of an implementation of the standard

Other Terminology: terms such as "critical" and "important" are referred to throughout this standards documentation however they have not been defined within these standards. It is expected these terms will be defined elsewhere as further explained in the User Interaction/Notifications section.

# Governance Impact on UI/UX Standards

There are multiple areas where clinical, information and quality assurance governance will impact on UI and UX design standards. Where these standards have identified potential for a serious safety impact surrounding the implementation of a design standard guideline the need for reference to controls has been highlighted. Where reference to clinical and/or information governance is required and needs to be linked to the implementation of these standards, is made explicit in this text.

The areas where further governance considerations are needed in the current form of the guidance are:

* Notifications
* Alerts

There are multiple other areas where care is needed in implementation of clinical mobile applications. If there is any doubt on the potential real-world impact of implementation of mobile app functions then the design or development team must seek clinical and/or information governance guidance and sign off.

# Referencing

These standards reference other standards and guidelines documentation where relevant. These references appear in parentheses.

# Updates

The standards in this guide will be regularly updated and reviewed at least annually. Update history must be logged.
