A walkthrough to set up user preferences/defaults can be used if required â€“ however walkthroughs must be limited to essential preferences/defaults only  
Walkthroughs to set up preferences/defaults must be activated at an appropriate time e.g. when the user first uses the app  
Users must be able to cancel walkthroughs unless they are critical to the app functions
